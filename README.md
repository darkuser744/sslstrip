<h2>Sslstrip Is A MITM Tool</h2><h3>sslstrip is a tool that transparently hijacks HTTP traffic on a network, watch for HTTPS links and redirects, and then map those links into look-alike HTTP links or homograph-similar HTTPS links. It also supports modes for supplying a favicon which looks like a lock icon, selective logging, and session denial.</h3><h2>This Script Clone The Repo From Here ===> https://github.com/moxie0/sslstrip</h2>
